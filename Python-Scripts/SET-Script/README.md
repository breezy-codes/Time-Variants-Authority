This Python script provides an interactive terminal-based experience for sending customised HTML phishing emails. It allows users to personalise email subject lines, sender names, and optionally attach files or embed tracking pixels. The script randomly selects a pre-generated HTML email template from a specified folder and sends the email using Gmail's SMTP server. As this has been themed for the HD project, the interaction in terminal allows for selecting from the random specified list of sender names and subject lines within the script.

## Disclaimer

This project was created for educational purposes as part of a HD project and should only be used in simulated environments for educational or research purposes. Sending phishing emails with malicious intent is illegal and unethical. Ensure this script is used responsibly and only in ethical testing environments.

## Purpose

The purpose of this script is to send personalised emails, allowing the user to randomly select or input specific details such as the subject line, sender name, and file attachments. It automates the process of selecting HTML templates and interacting with the Gmail SMTP server. This script interacts with the user via terminal input to customise the email sending process. The interactive prompts guide the user through setting up key parameters of the email such as subject lines, sender names, and attachments, creating a personalised and flexible experience. This could be extended out for further customisation, or simplified for a more streamlined experience.

### Key Features

- **Random HTML Template Selection**: The script scans a specified folder for HTML templates and randomly selects one to serve as the email body.
  
- **Interactive User Prompts**: Users are asked to input or randomly generate:
  - The subject line of the email.
  - The sender name of the email.
  
- **Optional Features**:
  - Embedding a tracking pixel by providing a URL for the pixel. This is embedded into the HTML with `display: none;` to make it invisible.
  - Attaching a file by specifying its path on the system.

To install the required libraries, use:

```bash
pip install smtplib email mime
```

In addition, it requires an app password from gmail for the script to send emails. This can be generated by going to your Google account settings, selecting security, and generating an app password for the script to use.
