## **Welcome to the Time Variance Authority**

The Time Variance Authority (TVA) is a bureaucratic organisation that exists outside of time and space, dedicated to preserving the Sacred Timeline. We are the unseen force that ensures every event in history happens as it should, maintaining order in the multiverse. Our mission is to identify, apprehend, and rectify any time variants who deviate from their predetermined paths. Those who threaten the stability of the timeline are brought to justice by our agents, who work tirelessly to protect the flow of time. When someone deviates from the Sacred Timeline, the TVA steps in to restore temporal balance and prevent the creation of dangerous branches in the multiverse.

## **Our Mission**

- **Preserving the Sacred Timeline:** Ensuring that every event in history follows the intended course. Protecting the multiverse from dangerous branches.
- **Apprehending Time Variants:** Identifying and detaining individuals who stray from their designated paths and become variants.
- **Restoring Temporal Balance:** Correcting anomalies to maintain the stability of the multiverse. Preventing the creation of new timelines, which could lead to chaos and destruction.

### **Timeline Preservation**

Protecting the Sacred Timeline is the TVA's primary mission. Our policies ensure that key events in history remain untouched by unauthorised influence. Key rules include:

- **Event Safeguards:** Protecting the Sacred Timeline from interference by time variants or external forces.
- **Continuity Enforcement:** Regular audits of timeline integrity to detect and correct any anomalies.
- **Temporal Surveillance:** Persistent observation of vulnerable periods in history to ensure the timeline remains unaltered.

### **Temporal Technology**

TVA-issued devices and technologies are vital tools in the management of the timeline. These devices allow agents to navigate the temporal landscape, track variants, and communicate across time. These devices are known as tempads.

---

- **Device Authentication:** All TVA-issued devices, including Tempads, have authentication protocols to prevent unauthorised access. Agents must log in with their unique credentials to access device functions.

- **Tempad Usage:** Tempads are the standard-issue device for all TVA employees, used for tasks such as temporal navigation, communication, and variant tracking. Guidelines for Tempad usage include:

- **Authorized Access:** Tempads must only be used by the employee to whom they are assigned. Sharing or lending Tempads is strictly prohibited and considered a breach of TVA security protocols.
