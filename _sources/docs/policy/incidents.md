## **1. Sylvie’s Assault on the TVA (2077)**

- **Date:** August 2077
- **Description:** Sylvie Laufeydottir, a variant of Loki, infiltrated TVA headquarters and caused significant disruptions to the Sacred Timeline. Her actions included disabling key security systems and attempting to destroy the Time-Keepers. This event caused a severe breach in timeline integrity, with several timeline branches emerging as a result.

## **2. The Multiverse Rift (2024)**

- **Date:** December 2024
- **Description:** A massive rift in the multiverse was caused by a botched spell cast by Doctor Strange, which accidentally pulled in multiple Spider-Man variants from alternate universes. This led to chaos as these variants, along with their respective villains, began to interact within the same timeline, threatening the integrity of the Sacred Timeline.
- **Resolution:** Doctor Strange and Peter Parker worked together to resolve the rift, though residual instability remains across several timelines. The TVA monitored the event closely, but allowed Strange’s intervention to preserve the Sacred Timeline. This incident continues to be under TVA surveillance.

## **3. The Snap Reversal (2023)**

- **Date:** October 2023
- **Description:** The Avengers’ time-travel efforts to reverse "The Snap" caused by Thanos led to multiple timeline deviations. While the Avengers’ intent was to restore half of the universe’s population, their tampering with the past created branching timelines that required TVA intervention.
- **Resolution:** The TVA allowed the core events of the Sacred Timeline to continue, but pruned several branches where the Avengers’ actions created major deviations. The retrieval of the Infinity Stones and their return to their proper places minimized the damage, but this event triggered the creation of numerous Loki variants, some of whom are still at large.
